# Hi there

  Snap is a game engine on top of SFML.NET proving a lot of utility and an architectural proposal to make a 2D game.
  Written in C# .NET Core 3.1, this library is multiplatform.

# Setup

* Start by creating a console project in .Net Core.
In the nuget package manager, run the command :
```Install-Package SFML.Net -Version 2.5.0```

* Add Snap as a reference of the project (no nuget distribution for now)
* Create an entry point for your program and initialize the content in the desired directories :

```csharp
 static void Main(string[] args)
{
    FontManager.Initialize("Fonts/");
    TextureManager.Initialize("Sprites/");

    VideoMode mode = new VideoMode(1920, 1080);
  
    GameWindow window = new GameWindow(mode, "MyWindow");
        
    window.SetScene(new MyScene());

    window.Open();
}
```
> Alright ! Your project is ready ðŸ˜Š

# GameWindow

* The GameWindow class is a parent node of your game. It manages the render window (or the targeted handle) and the gameloop. GameWindow is derived from the ```SFML.Graphics.RenderWindow``` class. Game window does not have any direct drawable objects. However, it contains a current scene whose role is described in the section below. 

# Scenes

* A scene represents a set of drawable object. It can represent a level, a menu, or any type of context in a 2D game. This is an abstract class, so you will need to implement it. 

```csharp
public abstract void Draw(GameWindow window); 
public abstract void OnCreate(GameWindow window);
public abstract void OnDestroy(GameWindow window);
```

* The ```Draw()``` method allows you to draw your objects. It is called at each frame. 
* The ```OnCreate()``` method is called when the scene is associated with a window. All objects must be instantiated here.
* The ```OnDestroy()``` method is called in two situations: either when the scene is replaced by another scene, or when window is closed. Properly free the resources it contains if necessary. 


# Grids
* Grids can be used to represent worldmaps ([Maps](#Maps)) and perform path find calculations ([Pathfinding](#Pathfinding))
* For each grid, there are events dealing with user inputs. The constructor parameter of Grid handleEvents disables the handling of these events,
  this increases performance on large grids. 

```csharp
public delegate void MouseEvent(T cell);
public event MouseEvent OnMouseEnter;
public event MouseEvent OnMouseLeave;
public event MouseEvent OnMouseRightClick;
public event MouseEvent OnMouseLeftClick;
```
* In order to improve performance, cells are drawn using **OpenGL primitives** (``` SFML.Graphics.VertexBuffer ```). 
* There are several methods for performing geometric calculations in order to recover cells according to their relative position, their position on the   world, or even to cast ray in a given direction.  
* In order to use the grids properly, we must call ```Grid.Build()``` after its instantation. 

## Orthogonal Grid

* Namespace : ```Snap.Grids.GridOrthogonal```

* Represents a two-dimensional orthogonal grid. Used to map tiles in a side scroller or top down game.

## Isometric Grid

* Namespace : ```Snap.Grids.GridIsometric```

* Represents an isometric grid. (The three coordinate axes appear equally foreshortened and the angle between any two of them is 120 degrees.)

# Pathfinding

* Namespace : ``` Snap.Paths.Pathfinder ```

* Snap contains a pathfinder, working with ```Snap.Grids```. This pathfinder is an optimized implementation of AStar Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

* Pathfinder constructor takes two arguments. ``` public Pathfinder(Grid grid, ICellMetaProvider cellMetaProvider) ```. 
* ``` ICellMetaProvider ``` is an interface that you will need to implement. It provides information on obstacles.

* This pathfinding algorithm assumes that there are eight possible cell-to-cell directions. This parameter can be reduced to 4 depending on the ```diagonal``` parameter of the ``` Pathfinder.FindPath()``` method.

# Textures

## Texture Manager

* Namespace : ``` Snap.Textures.TextureManager ```

* TextureManager is a singleton allowing to manage the textures of all renderers. This class works as a cache during program execution. . 
  The class must be initialized when the program is started. The path to the textures must be specified in parameters of the ```TextureManager.Initialize(String path,bool pixelInterpolation = false)``` method. 

* It is possible to retrieve all the textures thanks to the ```TextureManager.FindAll()``` method 
* The ```TextureManager.GetRecord(String name)``` function loads a texture into memory if it has not been loaded and returns the result. It is also possible to unload it using the ```TextureManager.Unload(String name)``` function.


# Maps

  * Namespace : ```Snap.Maps.Map ```

  * As the name suggests, Maps are a way to map tiles onto a grid. 
  * In Snap, a map is built from a grid. (Isometric or Orthogonal) and is divided into several layers. 
    The layers drawn one on top of the other. ```LayerEnum``` is used to enumerate them. It is possible to add up to 8 layers to a 2D map. 

  * It is possible to add a tile to the map using the ```Map.AddElement(LayerEnum layer, Cell cell, ElementRecord element)``` method. 
    The element is automatically placed in the center of the cell but will not be resized. You can perform resizing operations beforehand on the affected sprites.  
  

# Utils

## Camera2D

  * Namespace : ``` Snap.Utils.Cameras.Camera2D ```
  * Camera2D is what you need if you want to scroll, rotate or zoom your world. They are also the key to creating split screens and mini-maps.
  you can use ``` Camera2D.Move(Vector2f delta) ``` to move the camera and ``` Camera2D.Zoom(float delta) ``` to zoom.

  * The ```View``` (SFML) field is public and allows you to perform additional calculations if necessary. 


## KeyboardCamera

  * Namespace : ``` Snap.Utils.Cameras.KeyboardCamera ```

  * KeyboardCamera is an extension of Camera2D. It allows you to quickly map keys to camera movements. the mapping can be defined using the ``` KeyboardCamera.KeysMapping```  field.

## FPSCounter

  * Namespace :  ``` Snap.Utils.FpsCounter ```

  * FPSCounter simply allows you to count the number of frames per second for the current execution. ```The FpsCounter.Update()``` function must be called at each frame and the result can be accessed via the ```FpsCounter.FPS``` field.
